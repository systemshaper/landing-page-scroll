# Landing Page Project

## Project Description
This project was developed as practice for adding basic javascript functionality to a landing page. Most of the HTML and CSS was provided by Udacity, while Daniel Hoover implemented the js to help bring the page to life.
## Usage
Scroll up and down the page to see each section highlighted once it dominates the view. 
Click on the section names in the navbar along the top of the page to observe a smooth scroll to the seleced section.
